# Visualizing what convnets learn with simple dataset
## Author: Sarang Zambare


This is a project that I undertook out to visualize what exactly does a convolutional
neural network "sees" when it tries to classify images.

The dataset that I used was a very basic one: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data
It contains a huge number of labelled images of cats and dogs from various perspectives and in different
backgrounds.
